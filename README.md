### Hi, my name is Mark :wave:
#### I'm a Full Stack Engineer :rocket:

I'm in the field building application with JavaScript, I enjoy working with React for the client-side and Node for the server-side, there are many tools in my toolchain I'm using daily, starting from some ecosystem friends around React all the way to DevOps tools.

Recently I've been playing around with Docker and Kubernetes and found it loving, I was going to use k8s for a project of mine (our team will reveal it later this year), but for development speed reasons I've decided not to going that way just yet.

Alongside Kubernetes, I'm really into the Security field, improving my understanding of networks and systems.
This not only sparks joy in me but also makes a positive impact on my code quality and security.

Feel free to check out projects I've been working on.

Have a good time! :wave:
